# styled-props

![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/johanneslumpe/styled-props.svg?branch=master)

This library is designed to enable creation of reusable UI components and is inspired by [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system). The main difference is that this version relies on objects for theme values and media queries, making it resilient to changes, e.g. when new values or breakpoints are added. Additionally it aims to give users proper auto-completion or theme and/or css values when using any of the helpers within TypeScript.
